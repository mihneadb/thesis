Benchmarking Distributed Filesystems for Many-Task Computing

* abstract
** distributed filesystem benchmark
** many task computing
** follows testing envelope
** easy to configure and use
** scaling built in

* introduction
** specific needs of Many task computing
** how MTC filesystems work
** why benchmarking them is different

* background and related work
** testing envelope
** memfs
** amfs

* a customizable benchmark for distributed filesystems

* evaluation
** redoing the benchmarks in the papers
** comparing the simplicity of use

* conclusions

* examples
